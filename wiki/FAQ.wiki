== How do I compare the structure of two mysql databases? ==

1. dump your databases with the following commands:
{{{
mysqldump -d DB1_NAME > DB1_NAME.sql
mysqldump -d DB2_NAME > DB2_NAME.sql
}}}

2. compare them:
{{{
python compdb.py DB1_NAME.sql DB2_NAME.sql
}}}

== How can I update my Django database with this tool? ==

This tool can be used as a lightweight solution to evolve the schema of your Django database.

Just drop compdb.py in your Django project directory. After making changes to your Django model, type the following command:

{{{
python compdb.py -a -K APP_NAME
}}}

Where APP_NAME is the name of the Django application.

This command should return the SQL commands to update your database schema. To apply them, simply log into your database:

{{{
python manage dbshell
}}}

Then paste the SQL commands.
